### SCENIC+ Workflow (Major Steps)

1. **Chromatin accessibility modeling (pycisTopic):**  
   - Perform topic modeling on scATAC-seq data to identify cis-regulatory topics (sets of co-accessible regions).

2. **cisTarget database creation:**  
   - Build motif/track databases from candidate regulatory regions.  
   - Databases are used to connect TF motifs with accessible regions.

3. **SCENIC+ analysis:**  
   - Integrate ATAC-seq (regulatory regions) with RNA-seq (gene expression).  
   - Infer TF–target gene regulons using motif enrichment + peak-to-gene links.  
   - Score regulon activity across single cells to characterize cell states.

# 🔴🔴🔴 PART A:  Preprcessing of scRNA -  Clustering and Visualization

## Overview

This step performs **cell-level preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization** for single-cell RNA-seq data.  

The goal is to **group similar cells together** based on their gene expression profiles and prepare the data for downstream analyses and interpretation.

**Key conceptual operations:**

1. **Normalization & log transformation**  
   - Makes counts comparable across cells and reduces the influence of highly variable cells.

2. **Dimensionality reduction (PCA)**  
   - Condenses thousands of genes into a smaller set of principal components capturing most variation.

3. **Neighbor graph construction**  
   - Identifies cells with similar expression profiles in the reduced-dimensional space.

4. **Clustering (Leiden algorithm)**  
   - Groups similar cells together, each cluster potentially representing a distinct cell type or state.

5. **Visualization (UMAP)**  
   - Projects cells into 2D space to see cluster structure and relationships.

6. **Marker gene plotting**  
   - Evaluates the activity of known marker genes to interpret cluster identities.

> ## Inputs
>
> - **AnnData object (`.h5ad`)**  
>   Contains the single-cell gene expression matrix.  
>
> - **Marker gene list**  
>   Text file of known genes to evaluate cluster identity.  

---

> ## Outputs
>
> - **Clustered AnnData object**  
>   Includes UMAP coordinates, cluster labels (`leiden`), and sample metadata.  
>
> - **UMAP plots**  
>   Cells colored by clusters and by sample.  
>
> - **Dotplots of marker genes**  
>   Summarizes marker expression across clusters.  
>
> - **UMAPs for individual marker genes**  
>   Visualizes expression of each marker gene across cells.  


---

## Why This Step is Recommended

1. **Defines cell types or states**  
   - Clustering organizes cells based on similarity, providing a clear structure for interpretation.

2. **Supports downstream analyses**  
   - Clusters and cell type labels can guide pseudobulk aggregation, marker gene evaluation, or further integrative analyses.

3. **Improves interpretability**  
   - Visualization and marker gene plotting help assign biological meaning to clusters, making results easier to understand and communicate.

## Part A Results: scRNA-seq results    

![Before Filtering QC metrics](figures/violin_QC.png)
Violin plots displaying quality control metrics such as number of genes detected per cell, total counts, and percentage of mitochondrial gene expression.

### Filtering Criteria

Quality control filtering was applied to exclude low-quality cells and potential doublets. Cells were retained only if they met all the following conditions:

- Number of genes detected per cell between **500 and 7000**
- Total counts per cell between **1000 and 30,000**
- Percentage of mitochondrial gene counts less than **25%**

This filtering step ensures removal of dead or dying cells, doublets, and technical artifacts, thereby improving the quality of downstream analyses.

# 2. Pseudobulk Export with pycisTopic 



## Overview

This step **executes the pseudobulk aggregation** using `pycisTopic`.  
- Takes the conceptual idea and TSV intermediates from Step 1 and **produces the actual BED/BigWig files** for downstream analysis.  
- Aggregates reads per **cell type × sample**, generating clean coverage tracks for visualization and peak calling.  

---

## [pycistopic_pseudobulk.py](pycistopic_pseudobulk.py)


1. **Aggregates fragments into pseudobulk TSVs** (if not already created)  
   - Combines all reads for each group into a single table of fragment coordinates.  

3. **Converts TSVs to standard formats**  
   - **BED files:** fragment positions formatted for downstream peak calling (MACS2, etc.).  
   - **BigWig files:** normalized coverage tracks for visualization in genome browsers.  

4. **Organizes outputs**  
   - Saves **TSV reference files** with paths to all BED and BigWig files for downstream pipelines.  

---

> ## Inputs
>
> 1. **Fragment files**: `fragments.tsv.gz` per sample (from the experiment).  
> 2. **Chromosome sizes**: defines genome boundaries (from UCSC or Ensembl).  

---

> ## Outputs
>
> 1. **BED files** – fragment coordinates per pseudobulk (cell type × sample).  
> 2. **BigWig files** – normalized coverage tracks for genome browsers or QC.  
> 3. **TSV lists** – references of all generated BED/BigWig paths.  

---

## Analogy

Step 1 was like **planning and creating the combined raw audio (TSV tables)**.  
Step 2 is where we **mix, normalize, and export it into clean, usable formats (BED/BigWig)** for analysis.

# 3. Peak Calling Step with MACS2

## Overview

This step identifies **peaks**, i.e., genomic regions that are significantly enriched for ATAC-seq fragments.  

- Pseudobulk files summarize the signal for each **cell type × sample**.  
- MACS2 uses these aggregated fragment coordinates to detect regions with **high accessibility**, likely representing regulatory elements such as enhancers or promoters.  
- The output peaks are later used to generate **consensus peaks** and for topic modeling in pycisTopic.

---

> ## Inputs
>
> 1. **Pseudobulk BED files** from the previous step  
>    - Contain aggregated fragment coordinates per cell type × sample.  
>
> 2. **Genome size** (e.g., `mm` for mouse)  
>    - Required for MACS2 to estimate background signal and calculate statistical significance.  

---

> ## Outputs
>
> 1. **Peak files (`.narrowPeak`)**  
>    - Lists genomic regions with significantly enriched ATAC fragments per pseudobulk.  
>
> 2. **BED files of peaks (optional)**  
>    - Can be used for merging into consensus peaks across samples.  
>
> 3. **Auxiliary MACS2 files**  
>    - Statistics and logs for quality control (e.g., peak scores, fragment pileups).  

---

## What it does? 

1. **Convert fragment files to BED format**  
   - Ensures compatibility with MACS2 (chromosome, start, end).  

2. **Call peaks using MACS2**  
   - Scans the genome to find regions with **more fragments than expected by chance**.  
   - Parameters like `--shift` and `--extsize` adjust fragment positioning to capture accessible regions accurately.  
   - Each pseudobulk sample is processed independently.  

3. **Store peak files**  
   - Produces a BED-like file of called peaks for each pseudobulk.

## Analogy

Think of the pseudobulk BED as a **heat map of open windows across the city**.  
- MACS2 finds **clusters of “hot spots”** where many windows are open at once — these are your peaks.  
- Each peak represents a genomic region with strong evidence of accessibility in that cell type.

---

✅ **Summary**

- **Purpose:** Detect high-confidence accessible regions from aggregated pseudobulk data.  
- **Inputs:** Pseudobulk BED files, genome size.  
- **Outputs:** MACS2 peak files (BED/narrowPeak) per cell type × sample, ready for **consensus peak generation** and downstream analysis.

# Consensus Peak Generation Step

## Overview

After pseudobulk aggregation and MACS2 peak calling, each sample (or cell type × sample) has its **own set of peaks**.  
- Different samples may have slightly different peaks because of biological variability or sequencing depth.  
- To do comparative analyses across samples or feed data into pycisTopic, we need **one unified set of peaks** — the **consensus peak set**.  

Think of it as **finding all regions that are open in at least one sample and merging overlapping regions into a master list**.

---

## What does it do?

1. **Collect all individual MACS2 peaks**  
   - Each pseudobulk BED file from Step 2 has peaks called separately using MACS2.  

2. **Combine all peak files**  
   - Concatenate all peak files into one large table.  

3. **Sort and merge overlapping peaks**  
   - Using tools like **bedtools sort** and **bedtools merge**.  
   - If two peaks from different samples overlap, they are merged into a single peak region.  
   - The result is a **non-redundant, genome-wide consensus peak set**.

---

> ## Inputs
>
> 1. **MACS2 peak files** (`*.narrowPeak` or BED)  
>    - Generated per sample/pseudobulk in the previous MACS2 step.  
>
> 2. **Optional parameters** (if any) for merging, e.g., minimum overlap or padding.  

---

> ## Outputs
>
> 1. **Consensus peaks BED file**  
>    - One unified list of all peak regions across samples.  
>    - This file is later used to define **features/regions in pycisTopic objects**.  
>
> 2. **Intermediate combined BED** (optional)  
>    - The unsorted concatenated peaks before merging.  


---

## Why it is needed

- Ensures **all samples/cell types are analyzed on the same set of genomic regions**, which is critical for:  
  - Accurate topic modeling (pycisTopic LDA)  
  - Differential accessibility analysis  
  - Integration with scRNA-seq metadata  

---

## Analogy

Imagine several people drawing maps of the same city, each highlighting where the windows are open.  
- Each map may differ slightly.  
- The consensus peak step **merges all maps into one master map** that shows all open windows observed across everyone.  


---

# 5. Merge  

1. **Combine all MACS2 peak files**  
   - Concatenate narrowPeak files from all pseudobulk samples into a single file.  

2. **Sort and merge overlapping peaks**  
   - Using `bedtools sort` and `bedtools merge`, overlapping or adjacent peaks are merged into single regions.  
   - This produces a **non-redundant consensus peak set**, capturing all regions identified in any sample.  

---

> ## Outputs
>
> 1. **Consensus peaks BED file**  
>    - A single BED file containing all merged peaks across samples.  
>    - This is used for creating **cistopic objects** and for downstream analyses like differential accessibility.  

---

## Analogy

Imagine each pseudobulk sample as a city map showing open windows (peaks).  
- Each map is slightly different because some windows are only open in certain samples.  
- Merging all maps produces a **master map of all windows ever open** — this is the consensus peak set.

---

✅ **Summary**

- **Purpose:** Generate a unified, non-redundant set of peaks across all pseudobulk samples.  
- **Inputs:** MACS2 narrowPeak files from pseudobulk samples.  
- **Outputs:** Consensus peak BED file, ready for cistopic object creation and downstream analyses.



# 6. TSS Generation Step in pycisTopic

## Overview

This step generates a **BED file containing the transcription start sites (TSSs)** of genes for the reference genome.  

- TSS regions are important for **quality control**, such as checking **TSS enrichment** in ATAC-seq data.  
- It can also be used to **annotate peaks** with nearby genes for downstream analyses.  

---

> ## Inputs
>
> 1. **Reference genome annotation**  
>    - Provided by pycisTopic via Ensembl gene annotations (e.g., `"mmusculus_gene_ensembl"`).  
>    - Contains gene coordinates, including TSS positions.  
>
> 2. **Genome build specification**  
>    - UCSC or Ensembl genome coordinates (e.g., `"mm10"` for mouse).  
>
> ---
>
> ## Outputs
>
> 1. **TSS BED file**  
>    - Contains genomic coordinates of all transcription start sites for the reference genome.  
>    - Example path: `outs/qc/tss_mm10.bed`.  



## What it does?

1. **Extract TSS positions from gene annotations**  
   - For each gene, determine the **chromosome, strand, and start position** corresponding to the TSS.  

2. **Convert to BED format**  
   - Each TSS is represented as a genomic interval suitable for downstream QC or annotation.

3. **Save TSS BED file**  
   - The BED file can be used for **TSS enrichment analysis** or annotating peaks to genes.

---

## Connection to Previous Steps

- This step **does not directly depend on the pseudobulk or MACS2 peaks**.  
- It **uses the reference genome annotation**, so it is independent of previous sample-specific steps.  
- The generated TSS BED file is primarily used for **quality control** (e.g., checking enrichment of ATAC signal at TSSs) and for **peak annotation downstream**.

---

✅ **Summary**

- **Purpose:** Generate a reference set of TSSs in BED format.  
- **Inputs:** Reference genome annotation, genome build.  
- **Outputs:** TSS BED file, used for QC and peak annotation.  
- **Relation to previous steps:** Independent; serves as a reference for evaluating and annotating pseudobulk/MACS2 peaks.


# 7. Creating Cistopic Objects Step

## Overview

This step creates a **cistopic object**, which is the central data structure used by pycisTopic for **topic modeling of chromatin accessibility**.  

- The cistopic object organizes **fragment data, peak regions, and QC information** in a way suitable for downstream analyses.  
- It is essentially a **single-cell peak-by-cell matrix** stored in a Python pickle file, with metadata attached.  

---

> ## Inputs
>
> 1. **Fragments dictionary (`fragments_dict.pkl`)**  
>    - Maps each sample name to its fragment file (`.tsv.gz`).  
>    - Produced or referenced from earlier steps (preprocess/pseudobulk fragment info).  
>
> 2. **QC results (`qc_barcodes_thresholds.pkl`)**  
>    - Information about filtered/high-quality cells, such as thresholds for minimum fragments, TSS enrichment, etc.  
>    - Derived from QC steps performed earlier.  
>
> 3. **Consensus peaks BED file**  
>    - Generated in the **previous consensus peak step**.  
>    - Defines the genomic regions (peaks) that will form the rows of the cell-by-peak matrix.  
>
> 4. **Blacklist BED file (`mm10-blacklist.v2.bed`)**  
>    - Contains regions of the genome known to produce artefactual signals, which are excluded.  
>
> 5. **QC output directory**  
>    - Provides additional QC-related files for integration.  
>
> 6. **Number of CPUs (`n_cpu`)**  
>    - Used for parallel processing.  
>
> ---
>
> ## Outputs
>
> 1. **Cistopic object (`cistopic_objects_mm10.pkl`)**  
>    - Single Python object storing the filtered peak-by-cell matrix and associated metadata.  
>    - Ready for running **topic modeling (LDA)** and other analyses in pycisTopic.  

---
## What it does?

1. **Load fragments and QC metadata**  
   - Filter cells based on QC thresholds.  

2. **Map fragments to consensus peaks**  
   - Assign each fragment from a cell to a peak, creating a **peak-by-cell matrix**.  

3. **Remove blacklisted regions**  
   - Exclude problematic regions that may generate false positives.  

4. **Store in cistopic object**  
   - Includes:
     - Cell-by-peak matrix  
     - Cell metadata (sample, cell type, QC info)  
     - Peak metadata (genomic coordinates, annotation)  

5. **Save as Python pickle**  
   - This object will be used for **topic modeling, clustering, and downstream analysis**.

---

## Connection to Previous Steps

- **Takes consensus peaks** (from merged MACS2 outputs).  
- **Uses fragment files** (from preprocessing/pseudobulk).  
- **Incorporates QC information** (filtered cells, TSS enrichment, etc.).  

- This step is **critical** because it transforms raw and pseudobulk fragment data into a structured object suitable for all downstream pycisTopic analyses.

# 8. Merging Cistopic Objects Step

## Overview

This step merges **one or more cistopic objects** into a single unified object.  

- In workflows with multiple samples, batches, or preprocessing runs, each cistopic object may represent a separate sample or subset of cells.  
- Merging combines them into a **single cistopic object**, making downstream analyses (topic modeling, clustering, DAR analysis) easier and consistent across all cells.  

---
> ## Inputs
>
> 1. **Cistopic object(s) (`cistopic_objects_mm10.pkl`)**  
>    - Created in the previous step.  
>    - Contains:  
>      - Peak-by-cell matrices  
>      - Cell metadata (cell type, sample, QC info)  
>      - Peak metadata  
>
> 2. **Output path (`merged_cistopic.pkl`)**  
>    - Where the merged cistopic object will be saved.  
>
> ---
>
> ## Outputs
>
> 1. **Merged cistopic object (`merged_cistopic.pkl`)**  
>    - Single object containing all cells and peaks.  
>    - Ready for:  
>      - LDA/topic modeling  
>      - Clustering  
>      - Differential accessibility analysis  

----
## What it does?

1. **Load all input cistopic objects**  
   - One object per sample or batch.  

2. **Combine peak matrices**  
   - Align peaks across objects to ensure **consistent genomic coordinates**.  

3. **Merge cell metadata**  
   - Keep track of **cell type, sample, QC info** for all cells.  

4. **Create unified cistopic object**  
   - Contains all cells and peaks in a single structure.  

5. **Save merged object**  
   - Stored as a Python pickle for use in downstream pycisTopic steps.

---

## Connection to Previous Steps

- **Takes individual cistopic objects** generated in the `create_cistopic_objects.py` step.  
- Aligns and merges them so that **all samples/cells are in one unified object** for downstream pycisTopic analysis.  

✅ **Summary:**

# 9. Adding scRNA-seq Metadata to Cistopic Objects

## Overview

This step integrates **scRNA-seq-derived metadata** into the merged cistopic object.  

- Single-cell RNA-seq preprocessing (clustering, cell type annotation) provides **cell type labels, sample IDs, or other metadata**.  
- Attaching this information to the cistopic object allows **linking chromatin accessibility topics to known cell types** for interpretation.

## What it does?

1. **Load merged cistopic object**  
   - Contains all ATAC-seq cells in a single structure.  

2. **Load scRNA metadata**  
   - Map cell barcodes to those in the cistopic object.  

3. **Attach metadata to cistopic object**  
   - Adds new columns in the cell metadata (obs) of the cistopic object.  
   - This allows **annotating cells with known cell types or clusters** derived from scRNA-seq.  

4. **Save updated cistopic object**  
   - The new object contains both chromatin accessibility data and scRNA-derived annotations.  

---

## Connection to Previous Steps

- **Takes the merged cistopic object** from the previous merging step.  
- **Takes metadata from scRNA preprocessing**, including clusters and cell type labels.  
- **Purpose:** Link ATAC-seq profiles to known cell types for biological interpretation and downstream analyses.  

✅ **Summary:**  
- **Why needed:** Without scRNA metadata, ATAC-seq topics cannot be directly assigned to cell types.  
- **Input:** Merged cistopic object + scRNA metadata.  
- **Output:** Annotated cistopic object ready for topic modeling and cell type–specific analysis.


# 10. Topic Modeling with Mallet (run_mallet.py)

## Overview

This step performs **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling** on the chromatin accessibility data stored in the cistopic object.  

- Each **topic represents a set of genomic regions (peaks) that tend to be accessible together** across cells.  
- Topic modeling reduces the high-dimensional peak-by-cell matrix into a **smaller number of interpretable patterns**, capturing regulatory programs or cell type–specific accessibility.  
- Mallet is a high-performance Java-based LDA implementation used here to efficiently handle large single-cell ATAC datasets.

### In GRN context 



### 🧩 What is a GRN Module?

In the context of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), a **module** is:

> A group of **genes and/or regulatory regions (peaks)** that are **co-regulated**, meaning they tend to be active together in the same cells.  
> Modules often correspond to the set of genes controlled by the same transcription factor or regulatory program.  

Modules help simplify complex GRNs by grouping together genes with coordinated activity, making it easier to understand regulatory patterns in single-cell data.

| NLP Concept      | GRN Concept (SCENIC+) | What Mallet counts            | What LDA classifies             |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Document         | Cell                  | Word occurrences per document | Topics in document              |
| Word             | Gene / Peak           | Frequency in document / cell  | Module membership               |
| Topic            | Module                | Co-occurring words/features   | Which genes/peaks form a module |
| Topic proportion | Module activity       | Counts in documents/cells     | Strength of module per cell     |

- **Outputs:** Topic-assigned cistopic object, Mallet model files, ready for downstream analyses such as clustering and DAR detection.



# 11. Adding LDA Model to Cistopic Object

## Overview

This step integrates the **topic modeling results generated by Mallet** back into the cistopic object.  

- After running Mallet, the topic assignments and distributions are stored in external files.  
- To continue downstream pycisTopic analyses (clustering, DAR, visualization), the **cistopic object must include the LDA model results** internally.  


# 🧬 LDA in SCENIC+ (after Mallet)

**Input from Mallet:** A count matrix of genes/peaks per cell: each row = a cell, each column = a gene/peak, each entry = how often that gene/peak occurs (or is active) in that cell.

## Step 1: Initialize Modules (Topics)
LDA assumes that each cell is a mixture of modules (like a mixture of topics in NLP). It randomly assigns each gene/peak in each cell to a tentative module.  
Example:  
Cell 1: [GeneA, GeneB, GeneC, Peak1, Peak2] → [Module 0, Module 1, Module 0, Module 0, Module 1]  
Cell 2: [GeneD, GeneE, GeneC, Peak2, Peak3] → [Module 1, Module 1, Module 0, Module 1, Module 0]  
At this point, module assignments are just random guesses.

## Step 2: Iterative Update (Gibbs Sampling)
LDA repeatedly updates the assignment of each gene/peak to a module based on: 1) which modules are common in this cell (cell-level distribution) and 2) which modules usually contain this gene/peak across all cells (feature-level distribution). The algorithm uses probabilistic rules to favor assignments that explain the observed co-occurrences better. Intuition: Genes/peaks that tend to appear together across multiple cells gradually get grouped into the same module.

## Step 3: Define Modules
After many iterations, LDA converges. Each module is defined by a set of genes/peaks that co-occur across cells. These are the regulatory modules: groups of co-regulated genes/peaks.  
Example:  
Module 0: GeneA, GeneC, Peak1  
Module 1: GeneB, GeneD, GeneE, Peak2, Peak3

## Step 4: Module Activity per Cell
LDA calculates, for each cell, how strongly each module is represented:  
| Cell  | Module 0 | Module 1 |  
|-------|----------|----------|  
| 1     | 0.6      | 0.4      |  
| 2     | 0.4      | 0.6      |  
| 3     | 0.7      | 0.3      |  
This tells us which modules are active in each cell, analogous to topic proportions in NLP.

## ✅ Summary
Goal of LDA in SCENIC+: Discover hidden regulatory structure in single-cell data.  
Input: Mallet counts of genes/peaks per cell.  
Output: 1) Modules = groups of co-occurring/co-regulated genes/peaks, 2) Module activity per cell = how strongly each module is present in each cell. LDA is essentially finding hidden patterns of co-regulation from the raw co-occurrence data prepared by Mallet.

# 13. Binarizing Topics Step

## Overview

This step **converts continuous topic distributions into binary accessibility matrices** for downstream analysis, such as differential accessibility testing (DAR).  

- Each cell has **topic proportions** from the LDA step.  
- Binarization transforms these proportions into **presence/absence calls**, e.g., a peak is considered "active" in a cell if its topic proportion passes a threshold.  
- This simplifies downstream analyses and makes them more robust to noise.

# 🔴🔴🔴 PART C:  cisTarget Databases for Motif Enrichment (Optional Step)

## Overview

This step involves **using cisTarget databases** for motif and regulatory network analysis downstream of pycisTopic.  

- cisTarget databases link **genomic regions (peaks) to transcription factor motifs** and candidate target genes.  
- They are required for **motif enrichment analysis, regulatory network inference, and linking DARs to TF activity**.  
- **Creating custom cisTarget databases is optional**, but can be done if you want to analyze a specific genome, species, or motif collection.  
- For speed and convenience, we will **rely on prebuilt databases** in this workflow.

---

## Prebuilt Databases

For mouse (`mm10`) or human (`hg38`), prebuilt cisTarget databases typically include:

1. **Motif rankings (`.feather` files)**  
   - Genome-wide ranking of regions for each transcription factor motif.  
   - Example: `"mm10-500bp-upstream-7species.mc9nr.feather"`  

2. **Motif annotations (`.motifs.tbl`)**  
   - Information about the motifs, including TF name, family, and source database.  

3. **Gene annotations**  
   - Links between regions and nearby genes, allowing assignment of TF motifs to target genes.  

- These prebuilt files allow **rapid motif enrichment analysis** without having to scan the entire genome manually.

---

## Role in Workflow

- cisTarget databases are used **after DARs or topic regions are identified**.  
- They allow pycisTopic to perform:

  1. **Motif enrichment analysis**  
     - Determine which TF motifs are overrepresented in DARs or topic-specific peaks.  
  2. **Regulatory network inference**  
     - Identify candidate TFs controlling cell type–specific chromatin accessibility.  

- Without these databases, the downstream steps (cisTarget enrichment) cannot run efficiently.  

---

## Using Prebuilt vs Custom Databases

- **Prebuilt databases (recommended):**  
  - Saves time, standardized, widely used, compatible with pycisTopic.  
- **Custom databases (optional):**  
  - Can be created if you need specific motifs, a custom genome build, or updated annotations.  
  - Takes longer but provides maximum flexibility.

---

✅ **Summary:**  
- **Purpose:** Provide genome-wide motif rankings and annotations for enrichment analysis.  
- **Prebuilt inputs:** motif ranking files, motif annotations, and gene-region links.  
- **Outputs/usage:** Enable motif enrichment and TF-target network inference in downstream steps.  
- **Optional:** Users can build their own database for customized analyses.



🚨🚨 **Note:** ===> I skipped this part and relied on prebuilt databases for speed 🚀

### What SCENIC+ does
SCENIC+ integrates these results to build and score regulatory networks:

**Link regions to genes**  
   - Connects accessible regions to nearby or correlated genes.  

**Combine TF–region and region–gene links**  
   - Builds TF → region → gene connections.  

**Score network activity per cell**  
   - Identifies which regulatory programs are active in different cell states.  

In details: 

1. **Prepare Input Matrices**
   - Extract peak-by-cell matrices or topic-specific binarized data from the cistopic object.  
   - Include cell metadata (clusters, cell types, scRNA info if available).  

2. **Motif Enrichment Using cisTarget**
   - For each DAR or topic-specific peak, identify enriched transcription factor motifs using prebuilt or custom cisTarget databases.  

3. **Regulatory Network Inference**
   - Combine motif enrichment with co-accessibility patterns (and optional scRNA co-expression) to link TFs to their predicted target genes.  
   - Construct a **gene regulatory network (GRN)**, identifying TF-gene relationships.  

4. **TF Activity Scoring**
   - Compute TF activity per cell based on accessibility of target peaks in the GRN.  
   - Produces a cell-by-TF activity matrix that can be used for clustering, visualization, or downstream analysis.  

5. **Visualization and Module Generation**
   - Generate regulatory modules: groups of co-regulated genes per TF.  
   - Create heatmaps, network diagrams, and motif enrichment plots for interpretation.

### Motif Enrichment in SCENIC+

#### 1. Where do the motif enrichment results come from?

The motif enrichment results ([`dem_results.html`](Snakemake/workflow/dem_results.html)) and `dem_results.hdf5` are generated from the **ATAC-seq modality**:

- Peaks/DARs are identified from ATAC (cisTopic + DAR analysis).
- SCENIC+ then tests for **differential motif enrichment (DEM)** in those regions.
- This step checks whether certain TF motifs are significantly enriched in accessible regions linked to specific topics, clusters, or conditions.

➡️ In short: **DEM is ATAC-driven**, but the motifs are mapped back to transcription factors (TFs).

---

#### 2. Why are motif enrichment results needed downstream?

The overall goal of SCENIC+ is to reconstruct **gene regulatory networks (GRNs)** that are supported by both chromatin accessibility and gene expression.  
The motif enrichment layer plays several critical roles:

- **TF prioritization**  
  - Many peaks can map to multiple TFs.  
  - Motif enrichment highlights which TFs are most likely active in a given state.

- **Connecting ATAC to GEX**  
  - Later steps integrate motif enrichment (from ATAC) with co-expression (from RNA).  
  - This is how SCENIC+ builds *regulons* (TF → target gene sets).

- **Filtering false positives**  
  - Expression correlations alone can give spurious TF–gene links.  
  - Motif support ensures that inferred connections have chromatin evidence.

- **Interpreting biology**  
  - Differential motif activity per topic/cluster helps explain which TFs are driving specific cell states.

---

✅ The **DEM results act as a bridge** between ATAC and RNA modalities.  
They make sure that downstream TF–target links are not just statistically correlated, but also **biologically plausible**.
